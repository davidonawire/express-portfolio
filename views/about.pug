            | For more than a decade, I’ve worked as a Product Designer focused on mobile and web applications. I had entered design with a background in coding and web development,
            | and “programming thinking” informed my approach to design. I also had the advantage of knowing enough about coding that I could work especially well with iOS and web
            | developers. Now, I’m bringing this extensive product development experience back to coding as I focus again on software development. Given my experience with client
            | applications, as well as my skill in holistic system design, I’m focused on Full Stack development. My long-standing expertise with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is enhanced
            | by a robust product design background, which now in turn informs my work with modern frameworks and server-side applications.
