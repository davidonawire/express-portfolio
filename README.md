# express-portfolio
A portfolio site built using Node, Express, and Pug templating. The site serves three main routes: the index (at /), an about page (/about), and any number of project detail pages with identifiers (/project/`id`). Basic error routing is also included. Project information is served from a JSON file which is parsed into Pug templates. The application can be started from the command line using `npm start`.
